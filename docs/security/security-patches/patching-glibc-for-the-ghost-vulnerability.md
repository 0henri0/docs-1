title: Upgrading Glibc for the Ghost Vulnerability
---

Ghost is a vulnerability that was announced on January 27th 2015, which affect the Glibc C library on Linux systems.  This vulnerability affects all linux distributions, and allows for a buffer overflow int he gethostname() function.
Shellshock, or Bashdoor, is a vulnerability that was discovered on September 12th, 2014 and embargoed until September 24th when it was assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2014-6271](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271). The vulnerability pertains to Bash, which is a widely used Unix shell. This vulnerability affects all Linux distributions and allows remote execution of commands using environment variables.

In addition to CVE-2014-6271, many other related vulnerabilities were discovered in the following days after the Shellshock patch. This guide will tell you how to safely upgrade your Linux distributions and secure your Linode against the Bash vulnerability.

# Checking the Vulnerability

You must first see if you are vulnerable. As there are several vulnerabilities, you will want to check your vulnerability status for each of them.



# Installing the Upgrade

Below is the relevant information for upgrading Glibc and ensuring that your Linode is no longer vulnerable to the bug. Each section is designed for individual distributions. The sections are written with the assumption that you have root access or sudo privileges. If you do not, you will not be able to run these commands.

## Ubuntu and Debian

To upgrade Bash on Ubuntu and Debian, run these commands to update and upgrade the Bash package. If you are not running as the root user, prepend `sudo` to each command:

	apt-get update
	apt-get dist upgrade

Re-run the commands in the "Checking the Vulnerability" section of this documentation to ensure it has been upgraded.
