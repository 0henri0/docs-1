title: Configuration change management with Puppet
---

Configuration management is the practice of coordinating changes to a single or multiple computing environments. Puppet is a contemporary tool written in Ruby that makes it possible to automate configuration management for all layers of a service "stack." Puppet can manage systems that range from workstations and staging environments to production servers and other systems.
