This guide describes an alternative to the *LAMP* (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack, known as *LEMP*. The LEMP stack replaces the Apache web server component with nginx (pronounced "engine x," providing the "E" in LEMP). Nginx can increase the ability of the server to scale in response to demand.

## Before You Begin

- Complete the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide, specifically [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#setting-the-hostname).

- If you are new to Linux systems administration, you may want to consider the [introduction to Linux concepts guide](/docs/tools-reference/introduction-to-linux-concepts) and the [Linux administration basics guide](/docs/using-linux/administration-basics).

- Update your system:

      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

{: .note}
>
>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Linux Users and Groups Guide](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups).

## Nginx

### Install the Nginx Web Server

To ensure compatability of installation and with future updates, install nginx from the Ubuntu package repository using `apt`:

    sudo apt-get install nginx

### Configure Nginx Virtual Hosting

Older versions of nginx specified site directories and other information in the main `nginx.conf` file, but newer versions, such as the ones included with Ubuntu 16.04, are more compartmentalized. As you read through this section, make note of each file's contents and location so that you are familiar with the structure and know where to go if you need to customize one particular aspect of your web server. 

Nginx uses `server` directives to specify name-based virtual hosts. Nginx calls these *server blocks*. All server blocks are contained within `server` directives in site files, located in `/etc/nginx/sites-available`. When activated, these are included in the main nginx configuration by default.

1.  Nginx includes a sample configuration that you may use as a template. To create a new file with a basic server block for configuration, enter the following command, replacing `example.com` with your domain:

        tail /etc/nginx/sites-available/default -n 13 | cut -c 2- | sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com 1> /dev/null

    The command above reads the example server block contained in the last 13 lines of the default site file, cuts out the `#` comment symbols, and outputs the result to a new site file.

    Alternatively, you may manually copy the last section from `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` into a new file, `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com`. You will have to manually remove the `#` in front of the relevant lines.

2.  You should now have the following server block in the nginx virtual host configuration:

    {: .file }
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
    :   ~~~ nginx
        server {
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;

            server_name example.com;

            root   /var/www/example.com;
            index  index.html;

            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            }
        }
        ~~~

    Replace `example.com` with your domain name. If your index page uses PHP, add `index.php` to the `index` line:

    {: .file-excerpt}
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
    :   ~~~ nginx
            index index.html index.php;
        ~~~

3.  The nginx example configuration uses `/var/www/` as a document root, but Ubuntu uses `/var/www/html` as a standard. Additionally, Linode guides encourage the standard practice of using a subdirectory called `public_html` to exclude web files that shouldn't be publicly accesible. Update the `root` directive to match these conventions:

    {: .file-excerpt}
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
    :   ~~~ nginx
            root   /var/www/html/example.com/public_html;
        ~~~

4.  Create the root directory referenced in this configuration, replacing `example.com` with your domain name:

        sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/example.com/public_html

5.  Enable the site, disable the default host, and restart the web server:

        sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
        sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        sudo systemctl restart nginx

    To deactivate a site, simply delete the symbolic link:

        sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com
        sudo systemctl restart nginx

    The source file is saved, and the site can be re-enabled at any time by recreating the symbolic link.

If you are using nginx to host more than one site, create multiple virtual host files using the method above.

You may also want to edit the `http` block in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, which applies across all sites and allows the following options, among others:

-   Hiding HTTP header information using `server_tokens`
-   Configuring SSL/TLS settings
-   Customizing log file paths 

## Deploy PHP with FastCGI

In order to deploy PHP applications, implement the following *PHP-FastCGI* solution to allow nginx to properly handle and serve pages that contain PHP code.

1.  Install the required dependencies:

        sudo apt-get install php7.0-cli php7.0-cgi php7.0-fpm

2.  Modify your virtual host configuration to include the location directive as shown below:

    {: .file }
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
    :   ~~~ nginx
        server {
                listen 80;
                listen [::]:80;

                server_name example.com;

                root /var/www/html/example.com/public_html;
                index index.html;

                location / {
                        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                }
                location ~ \.php$ {
                        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
                        include fastcgi_params;
                        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
                        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/html/example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
                }
        }
        ~~~

3.  Restart the `php7.0-fpm` and `nginx` services:

        sudo systemctl restart php7.0-fpm nginx

Congratulations! You can now deploy PHP scripts with your web server.

## Install the MySQL Database Server

The MySQL database engine is one of the leading open-source relational database engines and is a popular database solution for web-based applications.

1.  Install the MySQL server packages and required PHP support for MySQL:

        sudo apt-get install mysql-server php7.0-mysql

    During the installation process you will be prompted to set a password for the MySQL root user via an [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) menu. Choose a strong password and keep it in a safe place for future reference.

2.  Run the `mysql_secure_installation` script, created to help secure fresh MySQL server installations.

        sudo mysql_secure_installation

    We've already set a strong root password in Step 1, and there's no need to replace it. All other actions should be performed in most cases. 

3.  Log in to the MySQL command line interface (CLU) as the root user. When prompted, provide the password set in step 1:

        mysql -u root -p

4.  Create a database and user with permissions for it. Replace `web` and `webuser` with appropriate names, and `password` with a strong password:

        CREATE DATABASE web;
        CREATE USER 'webuser' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON web.* TO 'webuser';
        quit

    You can now provide the credentials for the `web` database and the `webuser` user to your application, which will now be able to use the database for its purposes. To ensure that PHP will be able to access the MySQL connector your just installed, restart the PHP service by issue the following command:

        sudo systemctl restart php7.0-fpm

## Optional: Test and Troubleshoot the LEMP Stack

In this section, you'll create a test page that shows whether nginx can render PHP and connect to the MySQL database. This can be helpful in locating the source of an error if one of the elements of your LEMP stack is not communicating with the others.

1.  Paste the following code into a new file, `phptest.php`, in the `public_html` directory. Modify `webuser` and `password` to match the information entered in the **Install the MySQL Database Server** section above:

    {: .file }
    /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/phptest.php
    :   ~~~ php
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>PHP Test</title>
        </head>
            <body>
            <?php echo '<p>Hello World</p>';

            // In the variables section below, replace user and password with your own MySQL credentials as created on your server
            $servername = "localhost";
            $username = "webuser";
            $password = "password";

            // Create MySQL connection 
            $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);

            // Check connection - if it fails, output will include the error message
            if (!$conn) {
                exit('<p>Connection failed: <p>' . mysqli_connect_error());
            }
            echo '<p>Connected successfully</p>';
            ?>
        </body>
        </html>
        ~~~

2.  Navigate to `example.com/phptest.php` from your local machine. If the components of your LEMP stack are working correctly, the browser will display a "Connected successfully" message. If not, the output will be an error message.

3.  Once you've verified that the stack is working, remove the test file:

        sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/example.com/public_html/phptest.php

### Troubleshooting

*   If the site does not load at all, check nginx's status and restart if required:

        systemctl status nginx
        sudo systemctl restart nginx

*   If the site loads, but the page it returns is the default nginx page, return to the [Configure Nginx Virtual Hosting](lemp-server-on-ubuntu-16-04/#configure-nginx-virtual-hosting) section above and check that the `root` directive matches your `example.com/public_html` folder.

*   If the page it returns displays "Index of /" or has a similar folder tree structure, create a test `index.html` file or a test file as shown above.

Congratulations! You now have a fully functional and fully featured LEMP stack for website and application deployment.

This document describes a compatible alternative to the "LAMP" (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) stack, known as "LEMP." The LEMP stack replaces the Apache web server component with nginx (pronounced "engine x," providing the "E" in LEMP,) which can increase the ability of the server to scale in response to demand.

Prior to beginning this guide, please complete the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/), specifically [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#sph_setting-the-hostname). If you are new to Linux systems administration, you may want to consider the [introduction to Linux concepts guide](/docs/tools-reference/introduction-to-linux-concepts) and the [Linux administration basics guide](/docs/using-linux/administration-basics).

## Set the Hostname

Before you begin installing and configuring the components described in this guide, please make sure you've followed our instructions for [setting your hostname](/docs/getting-started#sph_setting-the-hostname). Issue the following commands to make sure it is set properly:

    hostname
    hostname -f

The first command should show your short hostname, and the second should show your fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

## Prepare System For Deployment

Before beginning with the installation of this web application stack, issue the following commands to ensure that your system's package database is up to date and that all installed software is running at the latest version:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade

## Install the Nginx Web Server

There are several viable and popular options for installing the nginx software. The first option retrieves packages from the Ubuntu Project's software repository and provides a stable and tested version of the web server.

The second option requires downloading the source for nginx from the upstream provider and compiling the software manually. Manual compilation makes it possible to run the most current version of the software at the expense of the testing and automatic updates from the Ubuntu project. All options are compatible, but in most cases we recommend using the packages from the Ubuntu repositories unless your needs require a version newer than the one available in the Ubuntu repositories. Possible reasons for compiling nginx yourself include access to optional compile-time modules and features added in more recent versions.

<!---For more in-depth installation instructions consider our [guide to installing nginx](/docs/web-servers/nginx/installation/ubuntu-10.04-lucid).

### Deploy from Ubuntu Project Packages

If you choose to install nginx from the Ubuntu repository, issue the following command:

    apt-get install nginx

This will install version 1.9.13 of the nginx server.

### Compile nginx from Source

If you want to compile and install nginx from source, issue the following commands to install the prerequisites:

    apt-get install libpcre3-dev build-essential libssl-dev sudo

Check the [nginx download page](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) and ensure that version 1.2.3 is the most recent "stable" version. If not, replace the version specified in the following command sequence with the latest stable version. Issue the following commands to download and install the nginx web server:

    cd /opt/
    wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.2.3.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf nginx-1.2.3.tar.gz
    cd /opt/nginx-1.2.3/

The following `./configure` command will prepare nginx for compilation:

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx --user=nginx --group=nginx --with-http_ssl_module

When the `./configure` command completes it will display the following information regarding the location of important nginx-related files after the installation is completed.

    nginx path prefix: "/opt/nginx"
    nginx binary file: "/opt/nginx/sbin/nginx"
    nginx configuration prefix: "/opt/nginx/conf"
    nginx configuration file: "/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf"
    nginx pid file: "/opt/nginx/logs/nginx.pid"
    nginx error log file: "/opt/nginx/logs/error.log"
    nginx http access log file: "/opt/nginx/logs/access.log"
    nginx http client request body temporary files: "client_body_temp"
    nginx http proxy temporary files: "proxy_temp"
    nginx http fastcgi temporary files: "fastcgi_temp"

Issue the following commands to compile and then install the software as specified above:

    make
    make install

Create a dedicated system user to run the nginx process under by issuing the following command:

    adduser --system --no-create-home --disabled-login --disabled-password --group nginx 

Now install and configure the [init script](/docs/assets/1131-init-deb.sh) to make it possible to start and stop the web server more easily. Issue the following command sequence:

    wget -O init-deb.sh http://www.linode.com/docs/assets/1131-init-deb.sh
    mv init-deb.sh /etc/init.d/nginx
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
    /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f nginx defaults 

Now, issue the following command to start the web-server:

    /etc/init.d/nginx start

## Configure nginx Virtual Hosting

Regardless of the method you use to install nginx, you will need to configure `server` declarations to specify name-based virtual hosts. There are a number of approaches to organizing configuration files with nginx. Regardless of the organizational strategy, all virtual host configurations are contained within `server` configuration blocks that are in turn contained within the `http` block in the `nginx.conf` file. Consider the following nginx virtual host configuration:

{: .file-excerpt }
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
:   ~~~ nginx
    server {
        listen   80;
        server_name www.example.com example.com;
        access_log /srv/www/example.com/logs/access.log;
        error_log /srv/www/example.com/logs/error.log;

        location / {
            root   /srv/www/example.com/public_html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }
    ~~~

Create the directories referenced in this configuration by issuing the following commands:

    mkdir -p /srv/www/example.com/public_html
    mkdir -p /srv/www/example.com/logs

There are several methods you can use to ensure that these options are included in your nginx configuration. If you're using the packages from the Ubuntu repositories, create the above virtual hosting configuration in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com` file and then issue the following command to enable the site and restart the web server:

    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
    /etc/init.d/nginx restart

To deactivate a site, simply delete the symbolic link by issuing the following commands:

    rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com
    /etc/init.d/nginx restart

The source file is saved, and the site can be re-enabled at any time.

If you installed the web server after compiling it from source you have a number of options. You may insert the server directives directly into the `http` section of the `/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file, although this may be difficult to manage. You may also replicate the management system created by the Ubuntu packages by creating `sites-available/` and `sites-enabled/` directories and inserting the following line into your `nginx.conf` file:

{: .file-excerpt }
nginx.conf
:   ~~~ nginx
    http {
    # [...]

    include /opt/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;

    # [...]       
    }
    ~~~

Modify the include statement to point to the path of your `sites-enabled` directory. In some circumstances, it may make more sense to create and include a file named `/opt/nginx-sites.conf` that is included in the `nginx.conf` file as follows:

{: .file-excerpt }
nginx.conf
:   ~~~ nginx
    http {
    # [...]

    include /opt/nginx-sites.conf;

    # [...]       
    }
    ~~~

Then, depending on the size and nature of your deployment, place your virtual host configurations either directly in the `/opt/nginx-sites.conf` file or include statements for server-specific configuration files in the `nginx-sites.file`. For more information regarding nginx configuration options, consider our [overview of nginx configuration](/docs/websites/nginx/basic-nginx-configuration).

Once you've configured and loaded the nginx configuration, restart the web server to implement the new configuration by issuing the following command:

    /etc/init.d/nginx restart

Make sure that the directories referenced in your configuration exist on your file system before restarting.

## Deploy PHP with FastCGI

In order to deploy PHP applications, you will need to implement the following "PHP-FastCGI" solution to allow nginx to properly handle and serve pages that contain PHP code. For a more complete introduction to this subject, consider our dedicated guide to [PHP FastCGI with Nginx](/docs/web-servers/nginx/php-fastcgi/ubuntu-10.04-lucid). Begin the deployment process by issuing the following command to install the required dependencies:

    apt-get install php5-cli php5-cgi php5-fpm

Consider the following nginx virtual host configuration. Modify your configuration to resemble the one below, and ensure that the `location ~ \.php$ { }` resembles the one in this example:

{: .file }
nginx virtual host configuration
:   ~~~ nginx
    server {
        server_name www.example.com example.com;
        access_log /srv/www/example.com/logs/access.log;
        error_log /srv/www/example.com/logs/error.log;
        root /srv/www/example.com/public_html;

        location / {
            index index.html index.htm index.php;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000;
            fastcgi_index index.php;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /srv/www/example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
    }
    ~~~

**Important security note:** If you're planning to run applications that support file uploads (images, for example), the above configuration may expose you to a security risk by allowing arbitrary code execution. The short explanation for this behavior is that a properly crafted URI which ends in ".php", in combination with a malicious image file that actually contains valid PHP, can result in the image being processed as PHP. For more information on the specifics of this behavior, you may wish to review the information provided on [Neal Poole's blog](https://nealpoole.com/blog/2011/04/setting-up-php-fastcgi-and-nginx-dont-trust-the-tutorials-check-your-configuration/).

To mitigate this issue, you may wish to modify your configuration to include a `try_files` directive. Please note that this fix requires nginx and the php-fcgi workers to reside on the same server.

~~~ nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    try_files $uri =404;
    include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /srv/www/example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
}
~~~

Additionally, it's a good idea to secure any upload directories your applications may use. The following configuration excerpt demonstrates securing an "/images" directory.

~~~ nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    if ($uri !~ "^/images/") {
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
    }
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /srv/www/example.com/public_html$fastcgi_script_name;
}
~~~

When you've completed the modifications to the configuration, make sure that the virtual host is enabled and issue the following command to restart the web server:

    service php5-fpm restart
    /etc/init.d/nginx restart

Congratulations! You can now deploy PHP scripts with with your LEMP stack.

## Install the MySQL Database Server

The MySQL database engine may be the leading open source relational database engine, and is a popular database solution for web-based applications. Issue the following command to install the MySQL server packages and required PHP support for MySQL:

    apt-get install mysql-server php5-mysql

During the installation process you will be prompted to set a password for the MySQL root user. Choose a strong password and keep it in a safe place for future reference.

[![Setting the MySQL root password in Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid.](/docs/assets/1129-66-lucid-01-mysql-root-password.png)](/docs/assets/1129-66-lucid-01-mysql-root-password.png)

Issue the following command to secure the MySQL instance:

    mysql_secure_installation

Answer all questions prompted during this process. If at any point you need to reset the root password for the *MySQL* server, issue the following command:

    dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.0

Issue the following command to get a root prompt for the MySQL server:

    mysql -u root -p

Enter the root password created above and then issue the following sequence of commands to create the `example` and `username` database users, grant the `username` user access to the `example` database, and exit from the database:

    CREATE DATABASE example;
    CREATE USER 'username' IDENTIFIED BY 's8723hk2';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON example.* TO 'username';
    exit

You may now provide the credentials for the `example` database and the `username` user to your application, which will now be able to use the database for its purposes. To ensure that PHP will be able to access the MySQL connector your just installed, restart the PHP service by issue the following command:

    service php5-fpm restart

Congratulations! You now have a fully functional and fully featured LEMP stack for application deployment.

## Monitor for Software Updates and Security Notices

When running software compiled or installed directly from sources provided by upstream developers, you are responsible for monitoring updates, bug fixes, and security issues. After becoming aware of releases and potential issues, update your software to resolve flaws and prevent possible system compromise. Monitoring releases and maintaining up to date versions of all software is crucial for the security and integrity of a system.

Please follow the announcements, lists, and RSS feeds on the pages linked below to ensure you are aware of all updates to the software and can upgrade appropriately or apply patches and recompile as needed:

-   [nginx Security Advisories](http://nginx.org/en/security_advisories.html)
-   [nginx Announcements](http://nginx.org/)
-   [Spawn FCGI](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi/news)

When upstream sources offer new releases, repeat the instructions for installing nginx, and spawn-fcgi, and recompile your software when needed. These practices are crucial for the ongoing security and functioning of your system.
