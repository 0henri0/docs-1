Ruby on Rails is a popular rapid development web framework that allows web designers and developers to quickly implement dynamic, fully featured web applications written in the Ruby programing language. These documents describe procedures for installing Ruby on Rails in conjunction with the Apache HTTP Web Server, and the "mod\_passenger" tool so that you can successfully deploy Ruby on Rails Applications on your Linux VPS.
