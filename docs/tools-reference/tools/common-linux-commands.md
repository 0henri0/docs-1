The guides in the Linode Common Commands series provide practical examples and introductions to powerful and useful Linux commands. These tools are useful in many general systems administration tasks and basic shell scripting functions. Rather than provide a dry catalog of functions as a manual would for these commands, this series provides a practical introduction with invocations and examples lifted directly from real-world usage.
