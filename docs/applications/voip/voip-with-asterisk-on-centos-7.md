Asterisk is an open source Private Branch Exchange (PBX) server that uses Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to route and manage telephone calls. Notable features include customer service queues, music on hold, conference calling and call recording, among many others.

This guide covers the steps necessary to provision a new Linode as a dedicated Asterisk server for your home or office.

>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If you're not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.


###Firewall for Asterisk

We'll be using iptables to secure our Linode against unwanted traffic. The Linode firewall configuration in the [Security Guide](/docs/security/securing-your-server) is a good starting point for *web servers*,
but it is not appropriate for an Asterisk phone server as Asterisk uses a different set of ports. Asterisk uses the SIP protocol for voice communications. If you want to hear the person on the other end of the phone,
you're going to need to open a range of ports that Asterisk will use for voice data packets as well as call signaling.

If this is a fresh Linode, you shouldn't have any firewall rules configured yet.

1. Run the command:

       sudo iptables -L


   It should show an empty rule table which looks like:

       Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
       target      prot opt source                    destination

       Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
       target      prot opt source                    destination

       Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
       target      prot opt source                    destination


2. Create `/etc/iptables.firewall.rules` using your preferred text editor. This file will be used to activate the firewall with your desired rules every time the Linode boots, so you're never running without firewall protection.

    {:.file }
    /etc/iptables.firewall.rules
    : ~~~
     *filter

      #  Allow all loopback (lo0) traffic and drop all traffic to 127/8 that doesn't use lo0
      -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
      -A INPUT -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j REJECT

      #  Accept all established inbound connections
      -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

      #  Allow all outbound traffic - you can modify this to only allow certain traffic
      -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

      #  Allow SSH connections
      #
      #  The -dport number should be the same port number you set in sshd_config, ie 8050
      #

      # MGCP - if you use media gateway control protocol in your configuration
      -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 2727 -j ACCEPT


      # Uncomment these lines if you plan to use FreePBX to manage Asterisk

      -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT

      #  Log iptables denied calls
      -A INPUT -m limit --limit 5/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: " --log-level 7

      #  Drop all other inbound - default deny unless explicitly allowed policy
      -A INPUT -j DROP
      -A FORWARD -j DROP

      COMMIT

>Leave IAX commented out unless you know you need it. IAX is "Inter Asteresk Exchange" and was meant to allow multiple Asterisk servers to communicate with one another.
>Some VOIP trunking providers use this, but most use SIP. Unless your VOIP provider requires it or you are running multiple Asterisk servers, you probably won't need IAX or IAX2.

###Start Firewall at Boot

CentOS 7 does not come with the iptables-services pre-installed. You will need to install it so that your firewall is automatically loaded at boot.

1. Run each command below, one at a time:

       sudo yum install -y iptables-services
       sudo systemctl enable iptables
       sudo systemctl start iptables

2. Load your firewall rules with:

       sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.firewall.rules

3. Recheck your Linodeâ€™s firewall rules by entering the following command:

       sudo iptables -L

   Your output should now look like this:

       Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
       target      prot opt source                    destination
       ACCEPT      all  --  anywhere                 anywhere
       REJECT      all  --  anywhere                 loopback/8              reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
       ACCEPT      all  --  anywhere                 anywhere                 state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
       ACCEPT      tcp  --  anywhere                 anywhere                 state NEW tcp dpt:8050
       ACCEPT      udp  --  anywhere                 anywhere                 udp dpt:sip
       ACCEPT      udp  --  anywhere                 anywhere                 udp dpt:iax
       ACCEPT      udp  --  anywhere                 anywhere                 udp dpts:ndmp:dnp
       ACCEPT      udp  --  anywhere                 anywhere                 udp dpt:mgcp-callagent
       ACCEPT      icmp --  anywhere                 anywhere                 icmp echo-request
       LOG          all  --  anywhere                 anywhere                 limit: avg 5/min burst 5 LOG level debug prefix "iptables denied: "
       DROP         all  --  anywhere                 anywhere

       Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
       target      prot opt source                    destination
       DROP         all  --  anywhere                 anywhere

       Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
       target      prot opt source                    destination
       ACCEPT      all  --  anywhere                 anywhere


4. To save this as your current rule set, enter the following command:

       /usr/libexec/iptables/iptables.init save

5. In a new terminal, make sure you can login:

       ssh exampleuser@xx.xx.xx.xxx


###Final Preparations

First, lets check that selinux is disabled. It should be disabled by default on CentOS 7, but since Asterisk installation will fail if its on, let's double check to be sure.

1. Edit your selinux configuration with your preferred text editor.  Ensure that the following value is set:

    {:.file }
    /etc/selinux/config
    : ~~~
      SELINUX=disabled
      ~~~


5. Install updated packages with:

       sudo yum update -y

6. Finally, reboot your Linode by typing:

       reboot



##Install Dependencies

Before we can install Asterisk proper, we'll need to install a few dependencies first. Run the following command (all as one line) to install Asterisk's package dependencies:

    sudo yum install -y epel-release dmidecode gcc-c++ ncurses-devel libxml2-devel make wget openssl-devel newt-devel kernel-devel sqlite-devel libuuid-devel gtk2-devel jansson-devel binutils-devel


###Install Pjproject

Pjproject is Asterisk's new SIP channel driver. It should provide improved call clarity and performance over older drivers.
Since pjproject has been moved to its own project, you'll need to install the pjproject driver first, before installing Asterisk.

First, lets create a directory that we can work in while we compile software. Make sure you are running as a regular user, not as root for these next steps.

1. Run this command, substituting in your username, to create a directory that we can work in:

       mkdir ~/build

2. Switch to that directory:

       cd ~/build

3. Use wget to fetch the pj sip fdriver source code:

       wget http://www.pjsip.org/release/2.3/pjproject-2.3.tar.bz2

4. Extract it with:

       tar -jxvf pjproject-2.3.tar.bz2

5. Change to the newly created directory:

       cd pjproject-2.3

6. Prepare the software to be compiled with the following command:

       ./configure CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -DPJ_HAS_IPV6=1" --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64 --enable-shared --disable-video --disable-sound --disable-opencore-amr

   You should not see any error messages.

7. Run each of the following commands one at a time, and check the very end of the output for anything that indicates an error:

       make dep
       make

   No errors? Good! Now we need to install the actual packages, which requires root permissions.

8. Run these commands, one at a time:

       sudo make install
       sudo ldconfig

9. Finally, check for proper installation of the libraries with:

       sudo ldconfig -p | grep pj

   You should get output that looks like:

       libpjsua2.so.2 (libc6,x86-64) => /lib64/libpjsua2.so.2
       libpjsua2.so (libc6,x86-64) => /lib64/libpjsua2.so

       libpj.so (libc6,x86-64) => /lib64/libpj.so



###Who's your DAHDI?


DAHDI, an acronym for *Digium/Asterisk Hardware Device Interface*, is the kernel module that controls telephone interface cards- physical cards that goes inside the computer case
which allow asterisk to connect to traditional phone networks. This type of card is usually used when adding Asterisk to an existing call center that uses older technology.
Since it's not possible to add physical cards to a virtual machine (and the need to actually do so is very rare anyway) you probably won't need the DAHDI driver installed.

There is one exception however- if you plan to host conference calls on your Asterisk box where more than one person can join a conference room, DAHDI also provides the required timing source for this feature to work.

Since installing the module doesn't do any harm and is rather simple to do, its probably a good idea to install it anyway unless you know for certain you will never need conferencing functionality.
If you don't want conferencing, you can skip ahead to the [Installing Asterisk](#InstallingAsterisk) section.


####Install the Vanilla CentOS Kernel

Since DAHDI is a Kernel module it needs Kernel headers in order to compile.
Unfortunately, the Linode supplied Kernel is a different version than the headers supplied in the CentOS repository, so we'll need to tell our Linode to use the vanilla CentOS Kernel instead of the Linode version.

You'll need to follow our instructions on [Running a Distribution-Supplied Kernel](/docs/tools-reference/custom-kernels-distros/run-a-distributionsupplied-kernel-with-pvgrub) before continuing with the next steps.

{: .caution}
>
>You should not attempt to replace the Kernel on a system that is currently in production!

###Build DAHDI

With the new Kernel in place, you're now ready to build DAHDI.

1. Switch back to your build directory:

       cd ~/build

2. Then download the latest DAHDI (version 2.10.2 at the time of this writing):

       wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/dahdi-linux-complete/dahdi-linux-complete-current.tar.gz

3. Untar the file:

       tar -zxvf dahdi-linux-complete-current.tar.gz

4. Then switch to the new directory:

       cd dahdi-linux-complete-2.10.2+2.10.2/


    {: .note}
    >
    >Your version may be different, so substitute `2.10.2` with the version that was extracted.


5. Build DAHDI with:

       make

6. Then install it by entering:

       sudo make install

   Followed by:

       sudo make config



##Installing Asterisk


We're now ready to install Asterisk 13, the current Long Term Support Release of Asterisk at the time of this writing.

###Get the Source

1. Switch back to your build directory:

       cd ~/build

2. Then download the latest version of Asterisk 13 using the command:

       wget http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/asterisk/asterisk-13-current.tar.gz

3. Untar the file:

       tar -zxvf asterisk-13-current.tar.gz

4. Then switch to the directory (substitute `13.5.0` for the actual version number)

       cd asterisk-13.5.0


###Enable MP3 Support

If you want to be able to use MP3 files with asterisk for Music on Hold, you'll need to install a few dependencies.

1. Install subversion with:

       sudo yum install svn

2. Then run:

       contrib/scripts/get_mp3_source.sh


###Configure and Build Asterisk

We're now ready to build Asterisk

1. Run the `configure` script to prepare the Asterisk source code for compiling:

       ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib64

   Keep an eye out for any missing dependences. There shouldn't be any though, since we've installed all of the prerequisites we needed.

2. Start the build process with the command:

       make menuselect

   After a short while, you should get a menu on screen that allows you to configure the features you want to build asterisk with.

3. If you want to use the MP3 format with Music on Hold, you should select `Add-Ons`, then use the right arrow to move to the right-hand list. Navigate to `format_mp3` and press enter to select it.

4. You might also want to select addition sound packages and music on hold packs on the left menu and enable the wav format of them for your desired language. (ie. use the `EN` package for English)

5. Press **F12** to save and exit.

6. Finally, let's compile Asterisk! Run the command:

       make

... Then grab yourself a cup of coffee. This could take a while. When it's done, you should get a message that says, "Asterisk Build Complete".

7. Install Asterisk on the system by running:

       sudo make install

8. Install sample configuration files with:

       sudo make samples

9. Configure Asterisk to start itself automatically on boot. This can be done by running the command:

       sudo make config


###Try it Out

Congratulations! You now have a working Asterisk phone server. Let's fire up Asterisk and make sure it runs.

1. Start Asterisk by typing:

       sudo service asterisk start

2. Once Asterisk is running you can connect to it by running the command:

       asterisk -rvv

   You should get a prompt with the current version number.

3. Type the command:

       core show help

   To see a list of possible commands.

4. To disconnect type:

       exit

   Once disconnected, Asterisk continues to run in the background.

##Next Steps

Now that you have an Asterisk server running on your Linode, it's time to connect some phones, add extensions, and configure the various options that are available with Asterisk. For detailed instructions, check out
the Asterisk Project's guide to [Configuring Asterisk](https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Basic+PBX+Functionality).
