<hr>

Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a first-person shooter by Valve. Hosting your own server gives you full control over your game and game modes, so you can play the exact flavor of CS:GO you want. This guide contains instructions on how to download the dedicated server and launch the game server.

## Before You Begin

1.  You will need a [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com) account and a copy of [Counter Strike: Global Offensive](http://store.steampowered.com/app/730/).

2.  Complete our guide: [Install SteamCMD for a Steam Game Server](/docs/applications/game-servers/install-steamcmd-for-a-steam-game-server.md). This will get SteamCMD installed and running on your Linode and this guide will pick up where the SteamCMD page leaves off.

>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Install Counter Strike: Global Offense

1.  Be sure you are in the directory `~/steamcmd`, then access the `Steam>` prompt.

        cd ~/steamcmd && ./steamcmd.sh

2.  Log in anonymously:

        login anonymous

    Or log in with your Steam username:

        login example_user

3.  Install CS:GO to the `Steam` user's home directory:

        force_install_dir ./csgo-ds
        app_update 740 validate

    This can take some time. If the download looks as if it has frozen, be patient. Once the download is complete, you should see this output:

        Success! App '740' fully installed.

        Steam>

4.  Exit SteamCMD.

        quit

    {: .note}
    >
    >To update CS:GO, run the above commands again.

## Configure and Launch the Server

1.  Create a file called `server.cfg` using your prefered text editor. Choose a hostname and a unique RCON password that you don't use elsewhere.

    {: .file}
    ~/steamcmd/csgo-ds/csgo/cfg/server.cfg
    :   ~~~ config
        hostname "<hostname>"
        rcon_password "<password>"
        ~~~

    For a complete list of available `server.cfg` options, see [this page](http://csgodev.com/csgodev-server-cfg-for-csgo/).

2.  Using [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/), you can launch your CS:GO server and keep it running without needing an SSH connection open. Launching Screen and CS:GO with the necessary options can be easily done with a script. **Be sure to replace `<public ip>` in the script's command with your Linode's IP addres**.

    {: .file }
    ~/start_csgo.sh
    :   ~~~
        screen -S "CS:GO Server" ./steamcmd/csgo-ds/srcds_run -game csgo -console -usercon +net_public_adr <public ip> -port 27015 +game_type 0 +game_mode 1 +mapgroup mg_bomb +map de_dust2 -autoupdate
        ~~~

    {: .note}
    >
    >The above example command launches a Dust 2 server in the competitive gamemode; change the command as you like for your own server. You may need to open UDP port 27015 in your firewall for clients to connect.

4.  Make the script executable:

        chmod +x ~/start_csgo.sh

5.  Launch the server by running the `start_csgo.sh` script from the `steam` user's home directory. Please note that if your current working directory is not `~/`, the game will fail to start.

        cd ~/
        ./start_csgo.sh

    The end of the resulting output is shown below. Your CS:GO server is now running and ready for players to join.

## Game Settings

### Game Modes and Types

You can change the game type and mode options to start different types of servers:

    Mode                   game_mode    game_type
    Classic Casual             0            0
    Classic Competitive        0            1
    Arms Race                  1            0
    Demolition                 1            1

These settings are changed in the launch command.

### RCON

When logged into the server, you can open the RCON console with the the backtic button (<code>`</code>), or your mapped key. To log in type `rcon_password` followed by your password. For more information regarding RCON, click [here](/docs/applications/game-servers/team-fortress2-on-debian-and-ubuntu#rcon).
