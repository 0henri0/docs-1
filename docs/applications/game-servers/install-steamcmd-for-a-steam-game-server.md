SteamCMD is a command-line version of the Steam client which works with games that use [SteamPipe](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamPipe). If you intend to host a Steam title on your own game server, installing SteamCMD is a prerequisite.

This guide is intended to get you quickly up and running with SteamCMD on your Linode. See Valve's [SteamCMD wiki page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) for more information and advanced setups.

>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, you can check our [Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Before You Install

1.  Familiarize yourself with our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide and complete the steps for setting your Linode's hostname and timezone. See our Securing Your Server guide to [create a limited user acount](/docs/security/securing-your-server#add-a-limited-user-account) which you will use to administer your Steam server.

2.  Update Your Operating System:

    **CentOS**

        sudo yum update

    **Debian / Ubuntu**

        sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade


## Secure Your Game Server

Game servers and clients are an especially ripe target for attack. Use our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide to:

*   [Add a Steam system account](/docs/security/securing-your-server#add-a-limited-user-account). Make the username `steam` to coincide with the rest of [Linode's Steam guides](/docs/applications/game-servers/), as well as Valve's official documentation. Do not add the `steam` user to the `sudo` or `wheel` groups. This is so your Steam installation is contained in a user account with absolutely no administrative privileges. The `steam` user's sole purpose is to run SteamCMD and your hosted games, nothing else.

*   [Harden SSH access](/docs/security/securing-your-server#harden-ssh-access)

*   [Remove unused network-facing services](/docs/security/securing-your-server#remove-unused-network-facing-services)

*   [Configure a firewall](/docs/security/securing-your-server#configure-a-firewall) for IPv4 and IPv6 **using the rulesets below**:

    **IPv4**

    ~~~
    *filter

    # Allow all loopback (lo0) traffic and reject traffic
    # to localhost that does not originate from lo0.
    -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT ! -i lo -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j REJECT

    # Allow ping.
    -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT

    # Allow SSH connections.
    -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

    # Allow the Steam client.
    -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 27000:27030 --dport 1025:65355 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 4380 --dport 1025:65355 -j ACCEPT

    # Allow inbound traffic from established connections.
    # This includes ICMP error returns.
    -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

    # Log what was incoming but denied (optional but useful).
    -A INPUT -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables_INPUT_denied: " --log-level 7
    -A FORWARD -m limit --limit 3/min -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables_FORWARD_denied: " --log-level 7

    # Reject all other inbound.
    -A INPUT -j REJECT
    -A FORWARD -j REJECT

    COMMIT
    ~~~

    {: .note}
    >
    >Some Steam games require a few additional rules which can be found in our [Steam game guides](/docs/applications/game-servers/). Steam can also use multiple port ranges for various purposes, but they should only be allowed if your game(s) make use of those services. See [this](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8571-GLVN-8711) Steam Support page for more information.

    **IPv6**

    Steam currently supports multiplayer play over IPv4 only, so a Steam server only needs basic IPv6 firewall rules, shown below.

    ~~~
    *filter

    # Allow all loopback (lo0) traffic and reject traffic
    # to localhost that does not originate from lo0.
    -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT ! -i lo -s ::1/128 -j REJECT

    # Allow ICMP.
    -A INPUT -p icmpv6 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

    # Allow inbound traffic from established connections.
    -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

    # Reject all other inbound.
    -A INPUT -j REJECT
    -A FORWARD -j REJECT

    COMMIT
    ~~~


## Install SteamCMD

1.  Newly created Linodes use 64-bit Linux operating systems. Since Steam is compiled for i386, install the appropriate libraries:

    **CentOS 7**

        sudo yum install glibc.i686 libstdc++.i686

    **Debian / Ubuntu**

        sudo apt-get install lib32gcc1

    {: .note}
    >
    >Running `dpkg --add-architecture i386` is not necessary at this point. Our Steam game guides add [multiarch support](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO) only when a game requires it.

2.  Switch to the `steam` user:

        sudo -u steam -i

3.  Create the directory for SteamCMD and change to it:

        mkdir ~/steamcmd && cd ~/steamcmd

4.  Download the SteamCMD tarball:

        wget https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz

5.  Extract the installation and runtime files:

        tar -xvzf steamcmd_linux.tar.gz


## Run SteamCMD

1.  Run the installer:

        ./steamcmd.sh

    That will return an output similar to below and leave you at the `Steam>` prompt:

        Redirecting stderr to '/home/linode/Steam/logs/stderr.txt'

2.  Most Steam game servers allow anonymous logins. You can verify this for your title with Valve's list of [dedicated Linux servers](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dedicated_Servers_List#Linux_Dedicated_Servers).

    To log in anonymously:

        login anonymous

    To log in with your Steam username:

        login example_user

    {: .caution}
    >
    > Be aware that the Steam CLI does **not** obfuscate passwords. If signing in with your Steam account, be aware of the security of your local screen.

    {: .note}
    >
    >You can exit the `Steam>` prompt at any time by typing `quit`.

## Next Steps

You're ready to install your first Steam game server and you should again be at the `Steam>` prompt.

1.  Set an installation directory for the game:

        force_install_dir /home/steam/game_title

    The `game-title` should be the name of the Steam game you're installing.

2.  Install the game from Steam's library:

        app_update server_id validate

    The `server_id` can be found in Valve's list of [dedicated Linux servers](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dedicated_Servers_List#Linux_Dedicated_Servers).

3.  From there, certain games may need a few more i386 libraries or firewall rules, and most will need their configuration settings edited. The game server should allow easy administrative access with as little interruption to players as possible. Its software should frequently be updated, and players' progress should be saved when the server is properly shut down. 

    Our [game server guides](/docs/applications/game-servers/) cover these requirements and contain various Steam tutorials which will pick you up exactly where this page leaves off.
