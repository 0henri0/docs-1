XMPP servers utilize the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp) to deliver real-time network presence and chat services. Most commonly associated with organizations like [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org/), programs designed for this protocol enable rapid communications between two or more individuals, with a number of extensions available for interacting with other networks. These guides will help you deploy popular open source XMPP server solutions on your Linux VPS.
