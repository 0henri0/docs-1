Seafile is a cross-platform file hosting tool with server applications for Linux and Windows, and GUI clients for Android, iOS, Linux, OS X and Windows. It supports file versioning and snapshots, two-factor authentication, WebDAV, and can be paired with nginx or Apache to enable connections over HTTPS.

Seafile has [two editions](https://www.seafile.com/en/product/private_server/): a free and open source Community Edition and a paid Professional edition. While the Pro edition is free for up to 3 users, this guide will use Seafile Community Edition with nginx serving an HTTPS connection, and MySQL on the backend.

>This guide is written for a non-root user. Commands that require elevated privileges are prefixed with `sudo`. If youâ€™re not familiar with the `sudo` command, see the [Linux Users and Groups](/docs/tools-reference/linux-users-and-groups) guide.

## Prepare Ubuntu

1.  Use our [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide to [harden SSH access](/docs/security/securing-your-server#harden-ssh-access)

2.  Update the system:

        apt update && apt upgrade

3.  Set up UFW rules. UFW is Ubuntu's iptables controller which makes setting up firewall rules a little easier. For more info on UFW, see our guide [Configure a Firewall with UFW](/docs/security/firewalls/configure-firewall-with-ufw). Set the allow rules for SSH and HTTP(S) access with:

        ufw allow ssh
        ufw allow http
        ufw allow https
        ufw enable

    Then check the status of your rules and list them numerically:

        ufw status numbered

    The output should be:

        Status: active
        
        To                         Action      From
        --                         ------      ----
        [ 1] 22                         ALLOW IN    Anywhere
        [ 2] 80                         ALLOW IN    Anywhere
        [ 3] 443                        ALLOW IN    Anywhere
        [ 4] 22 (v6)                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
        [ 5] 80 (v6)                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
        [ 6] 443 (v6)                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)

    {: .note}
    >
    > If you don't want UFW allowing SSH on port 22 for both IPv4 and IPv6, you can delete it. For example, you can delete the rule to allow SSH over IPv6 with `ufw delete 4`.

4.  Set the Linode's hostname. We'll call it *seafile* as an example:

        hostnamectl set-hostname seafile

5.  On first boot, your Linode's timezone will be set to UTC. Changing this is optional, but if you wish, use:

        dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

6.  Create a standard user account with root privileges. As an example, we'll call the user *sfadmin*:

        adduser sfadmin
        adduser sfadmin sudo

7.  Log out of your Linode's root user account and back in as *sfadmin*:

        exit
        ssh sfadmin&<your_linode's>ip>


## Install and Configure MySQL

You should now be logged into your Linode as *sfadmin*.

1.  During Installation, you will be asked to assign a password for the root mysql user:

        sudo apt install mysql-server-5.7
    
    {: .note}
    >
    > Be sure to install the package `mysql-server-5.7`, not `mysql-server`. The package with the version number works correctly, b.

2.  Run the *mysql_secure_installation* script:

        sudo mysql_secure_installation


## Create a TLS Certificate for use with nginx

If you don't already have an SSL/TLS certificate, you can create one. Note that this will be a self-signed certificate, so it will cause web browsers to complain about an insecure connection. We'll address that later in the guide.

1.  Change to the root and to the location where we'll store the certificate files:

        sudo su - root
        cd /etc/ssl

2.  Create server's certificate and key files:

        openssl genrsa -out caprivkey.pem 4096
        openssl req -new -x509 -key caprivkey.pem -out cacert.pem


## Install and Configure nginx

1.  Install nginx from Ubuntu's repository:

        sudo apt install nginx

2.  Create the site configuration file. The only line you need to change below is `server_name`. For more HTTPS configuration options, see our guide on [TLS Best Practices with nginx](/docs/web-servers/nginx/nginx-ssl-and-tls-deployment-best-practices).

    {: .file}
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/seafile.conf
    :   ~~~
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    rewrite ^ https://$http_host$request_uri? permanent;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
}

   server {
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cacert.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;
        server_name example.com;

        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        add_header   Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains";
        add_header   X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
        add_header   X-Frame-Options DENY;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_ciphers  "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH !RC4";
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;
        
        fastcgi_param   HTTPS               on;
        fastcgi_param   HTTP_SCHEME         https;

    location / {
        fastcgi_pass    127.0.0.1:8000;
        fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME     $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO           $fastcgi_script_name;

        fastcgi_param    SERVER_PROTOCOL        $server_protocol;
        fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING        $query_string;
        fastcgi_param   REQUEST_METHOD      $request_method;
        fastcgi_param   CONTENT_TYPE        $content_type;
        fastcgi_param   CONTENT_LENGTH      $content_length;
        fastcgi_param    SERVER_ADDR         $server_addr;
        fastcgi_param    SERVER_PORT         $server_port;
        fastcgi_param    SERVER_NAME         $server_name;
        fastcgi_param   REMOTE_ADDR         $remote_addr;

        access_log      /var/log/nginx/seahub.access.log;
        error_log       /var/log/nginx/seahub.error.log;
        fastcgi_read_timeout 36000;
        client_max_body_size 0;
    }

    location /seafhttp {
        rewrite ^/seafhttp(.*)$ $1 break;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082;
        client_max_body_size 0;
        proxy_connect_timeout  36000s;
        proxy_read_timeout  36000s;
        proxy_send_timeout  36000s;
        send_timeout  36000s;
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }

    location /media {
        root /home/sfadmin/seafile-server-latest/seahub;
    }
}
        ~~~

3.  Disable the default site configuration and enable the one you just created:

        sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
        sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/seafile.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/seafile.conf

4.  Run the nginx configuration test and restart the web server. If the test fails, it will give you a brief description of what's wrong so you can troubleshoot the problem.

        sudo nginx -t
        sudo systemctl restart nginx


## Configure and Install Seafile

1.  [Seafile's manual](https://manual.seafile.com/deploy/using_mysql.html) advises of a particular directory tree to ease upgrades.

        mkdir installed

2.  Download the Seafile CE 64 bit Linux server. You'll need to get the exact link from [seafile.com](https://www.seafile.com/en/download/). Once you have the URL, use `wget` to download it to the home directory of *sfadmin*. 

        cd ~/
        wget <link>

3.  Extract the tarball to sfadmin's home and move it when finished:

        tar -xzvf seafile-server*.tar.gz
        mv seafile-server*.tar.gz installed

4.  Install dependency packages for Seafile:

        sudo apt install python2.7 libpython2.7 python-setuptools python-imaging python-ldap python-mysqldb python-memcache python-urllib3

5.  Run the installation script:

        cd seafile-server-* && ./setup-seafile-mysql.sh

6.  Start the server.

        ./seafile.sh start
        ./seahub.sh start-fastcgi

    The `seahub.sh` script will set up an admin user account used to log into Seafile. You'll be asked for a login email and to create a password.

        ![First time starting Seafile](/docs/assets/seafile-firststart.png)

   Seafile should now be accessible from a web browser using `server_name` you set earlier in nginx's `seafile.conf` file. Nginx will redirect to HTTPS and as mentioned earlier, your browser will warn of an insecure HTTPS connection due to the self-signed certificate you created. Once you ***'ll see the Seafile login.

## Start Seafile Automatically on Sever Bootup

The `seafile.sh` and `seahub.sh` scripts don't automatically run if your Linode were to reboot.

1.  Create the systemd unit files:

    {: .file}
    /etc/systemd/system/seahub.service
    :   ~~~ config
        [Unit]
        Description=Seafile Server
        After=network.target mysql.service

        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=/home/sfadmin/seafile-server-latest/seafile.sh start
        ExecStop=/home/sfadmin/seafile-server-latest/seafile.sh stop
        RemainAfterExit=yes
        User=sfadmin
        Group=sfadmin

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        ~~~


    {: .file}
    /etc/systemd/system/seahub.service
    :   ~~~ config
        [Unit]
        Description=Seafile Hub
        After=network.target seafile.service

        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=/home/sfadmin/seafile-server-latest/seahub.sh start-fastcgi
        ExecStop=/home/sfadmin/seafile-server-latest/seahub.sh stop
        RemainAfterExit=yes
        User=sfadmin
        Group=sfadmin

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
        ~~~

2.  Then enable the services:

        sudo systemctl enable seafile
        sudo systemctl enable seahub

    You can verify they've started successfully with:

        sudo systemctl status seafile
        sudo systemctl status seafile
