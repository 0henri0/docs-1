This guide is the third of a three part series to configure a hardened OpenVPN server and its clients. Thought it's recommended that you have first completed parts one and two of the series, [***]() and [How to Set Up a VPN Tunnel with Debian 8](/docs/networking/vpn/***), this guide stands on its own as a general tutorial for configuring OpenVPN clients of various platforms.

## Before you Begin

You must have already generated the client credentials which were generated by your OpenVPN server. These are the root (CA) certificate, client certificates, client keys, HMAC secret key and client configuration file. If you're picking up from part two of the series, all of these files will be on your server locatedin `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa`.

### Transfer Client Credentials

Each client needs a copy of the Certificiate Authority, its own certificate and key, the HMAC sigature key and a client configuration file. Specifically we want:

*  `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ca.crt`
*  `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client1.crt`
*  `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/client1.key`
*  `/etc/openvpn/ta.key`
*  `~/client.conf`

These files must be copied to the client device using an encrypted transfer protocol like [SCP or SFTP](/docs/tools-reference/linux-system-administration-basics#how-to-upload-files-to-a-remote-server). FTP or telnet should *not* be used because these protocols do not encrypt traffic at all--even authentication with the FTP and telnet daemon.

Transfer these keys with the utmost attention to security. Anyone who has the key or is able to intercept an unencrypted copy of the key will be able to gain full access to your VPN.

### Installing Client-Side Software

This varies depending on the specific operating system or distribution running on the client machine.

#### Android

There are situations where you could want to access your Linode's OpenVPN server from another Linode or server.

1.  

2.  

#### IaaS

There are situations where you could want to access your Linode's OpenVPN server from another Linode or server.

#### iOS

There are situations where you could want to access your Linode's OpenVPN server from another Linode or server.

1.  

2.  

#### Linux

Most network management tools provide some facility for managing connections to a VPN. Configure connections to your OpenVPN through the same interface where you might configure wireless or ethernet connections.


1.  OpenVPN needs to be installed and to configure throught Network Manager's GUIyou'll need `network-manager-openvpn-gnome`. This one package will bring in the other necessary dependencies, if not at least alert you of them.

Depending on your distro, you'll need either the package `network-manager-openvpn` or `networkmanager-openvpn` which will bring in the necessary dependencies with it, if not at least tell you what they are (re: Pacman).

    sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn

2.  Add an OpenVPN type VPN connection.

3.  In the next window you must tell OpenVPN. By now, you should have the VPN client's credentials on the client machine. Point OpenVPN to the credential locations; the **Gateway:** field should be the IP address of your OpenVPN server.

4. Click **Advanced**. On the **General** tab, check the box for **Use LZO data compression. On the **Security** tab, choose the cipher and hashing algorithm you assigned in your server's `server.conf` file. Part one of this guide chose **AES-256-CBC** and **SHA-384**. Click **OK** to close the Advanced Options window.

5.  Back in the VPN connection edit window, choose the **IPv4 Settings** tab. Here is where you can tell the client to override any DNS server settings your OpenVPN server is using. 



Click **Save** to close the VPN connection edit window.



#### OS X

1.  Download and open [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/).

2.  At the "Welcome to Tunnelblick" dialog box, click **I have configuration files**.

    ![I have configuration files](/docs/assets/1342-tunnelblick1.png)

3.  At the next dialog box asking for your configuration type, click **OpenVPN Configuration(s)**.

    ![Welcome to Tunnelblick](/docs/assets/1347-tunnelblick3.png
)

4.  Tunnelblick will open a Finder window into which you can copy the `client1.conf`, `client1.ca`, `client1.crt` and key files.  Follow the rest of the instructions shown in Tunnelblick to create and install your Tunnelblick configuration file.

5.  Click on the tray icon to begin the connection. A notification will show you the status as it connects:

#### Windows

1.  Download an run the OpenVPN [Windows installer](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html).

2.  Drop the client files which were copied over from the server into:

        C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config

3.  Run OpenVPN as an administrator to connect.

##  Revoking a Client Certificate

To remove a user's access to the VPN server:

1.  Run the `vars` script.

        cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
        source ./vars

2.  Run the `revoke-full` script, substituting **client1** with the name of the client whose certificate you want to revoke:

        ./revoke-full client1

### Accessing your Linode over the VPN

To test your connection, connect to the VPN connection from your local machine, then access one of the many [websites that will display your public IP address](http://www.whatismyip.com/). If the IP address displayed doesn't match the IP address of your Linode, your traffic is not being filtered through your Linode or encrypted by the VPN. If the IP matches, network traffic from your local machine is being filtered through your Linode and encrypted over the VPN, and you have successfully completed your OpenVPN setup!

Once you're connected to your VPN, you can SSH to another Linode over the private network. If you want to access files directly from your Linode, you will need to install a compatible network file sharing protocol, like [Samba](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba/SambaServerGuide), [NFS](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SettingUpNFSHowTo), or [Appletalk](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppleTalk).
