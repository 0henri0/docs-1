Your disk images and configuration profiles can be copied to or from another Linode, server, or computer in your home or office. This is an effective way to back up your Linode to another server, migrate your Linode to another machine, or copy an existing server to your Linode. These guides explain how to migrate and clone your disk images and configuration profiles from one server to another.
