CouchDB is a document-centered database system that provides fast and flexible access to structured schema-less data. Built in the Erlang Language, CouchDB is intended to not only be easy to use, but also have the capability to accommodate many different usage profiles with great ease. These guides will help you install and configure CouchDB on your Linode VPS.
