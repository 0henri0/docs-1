# Become a Linode Community Contributor!
 
Linode is looking for awesome technical writers and subject matter experts to contribute to our comprehensive selection of tutorials about Linux and cloud infrastructure. If you have technical knowledge and the ability to explain things clearly, our editors will help you copy edit and publish your guide to our rich knowledge base with over a million unique page views each month. You may make up to $400 depending on topic difficulty.
 
Simply choose a topic from the list below and submit a writing sample. If we accept your submission after a review, one of our editors will help you get started, and you’ll be on your way.

## Submit a writing sample

The quality of the writing sample is the primary way we evaluate Linode Community Contributor applications.
While you don’t have to be an experienced technical writer, you are the subject matter expert, and your guide should explain the steps and options clearly.

To be considered, submit your sample in one of the following ways:

1)  Submit the introduction and first two steps of the tutorial you selected from the list above.

2) Submit a technical article (e.g. blog post, tutorial) you’ve written in the past that demonstrates your abilities on a different topic. Please make sure your sample has a similar level of technical content and explanations as the tutorials found in Linode's Guides and Tutorials.

At this time we are only accepting articles written in English. Don’t worry if your language isn’t perfect, we’ll fix that up in the editing stage.
