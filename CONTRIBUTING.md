# Become a Linode Community Contributor!
 
Linode is looking for awesome technical writers and subject matter experts to contribute to our comprehensive selection of tutorials about Linux and cloud infrastructure. If you have technical knowledge and the ability to explain things clearly, our editors will help you copy edit and publish your guide to our rich knowledge base with over a million unique page views each month. You may make up to $400 depending on topic difficulty.
 
Simply choose a topic from the list below and submit a writing sample. If we accept your submission after a review, one of our editors will help you get started, and you’ll be on your way. 
 
## List of available topics

## Submit a writing sample

The quality of the writing sample is the primary way we evaluate Linode Community Contributor applications.
While you don’t have to be an experienced technical writer, you are the subject matter expert, and your guide should explain the steps and options clearly.

To be considered, submit your sample in one of the following ways:

1)  Submit the introduction and first two steps of the tutorial you selected from the list above.

2) Submit a technical article (e.g., blog post, tutorial) you’ve written in the past that demonstrates your abilities to effectively guide a reader through a different topic. Please make sure your sample has a similar level of technical content and explanation as the tutorials already found in Linode's Guides and Tutorials.

At this time we are only accepting articles written in English. Don’t worry if your language isn’t perfect, we’ll fix that up in the editing stage.

# How to write a good Community Guide

Use the [Linode writers' guide](docs/linode-writers-guide.md). While you're writing, make sure your content is:

*   Accurate. Your instructions should be straightforward and technically sound.
*   Formatted. Your style should use [PHP Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) formatting and match the Linode Docs [style guide](docs/linode-writers-formatting-guide.md).
*   Original. Your content should be original material written for Linode. We will not accept submissions that have been copied from other sources.

# How to submit your article

Submit your article as a pull request on GitHub or by email to <contribute@linode.com>. Articles should be sent as a plain text or PHP Markdown Extra file attachment. When submitting through GitHub, please create a new branch for your changes.

Got images? Attach them as **.png** or **.jpg** files. If an image is greater than 650 pixels wide, please send both the original and a 650-pixel-wide version.

Submission checklist:

*   Article in **.txt** or **.md** format
*   Images
*   Your name, as you want it to appear on the site

Once you've submitted your article, here's what you can expect:

1.  You'll receive a brief response acknowledging your submission.
2.  We will do a technical review of your material. This will take a few days.
3.  If we accept it for publication, we will next do a copy edit of the article. This will take a few days.
4.  You may receive questions or comments from us or a request for a resubmission with a few changes or clarifications. Resolving these issues will take a few days.
5.  Once we have a final version ready in the publishing queue, we will let you know. At that point, you will have 36 hours to respond and consent to our publication of the final version.
6.  If you respond positively (no response from you will be taken as implied consent to publish), we will publish the article.

# Reasons Your Guide May Be Rejected
As much as we would like to support all writers and their submissions, we can not accept every one that we receive. Here is a checklist of issues you can follow to strengthen your submitted guide:

*  Guide has not enough content, or lacks original content. For example, if the guide too closely resembles a current guide either by Linode or on another source.
*  Content of the guide doesn't address requested topic. (See topic list.)
*  Guide is a duplicate of your own content from your personal blog, wiki submissions or forum posts.
*  Topic is sufficiently documented in official wikis, manual pages, etc.
*  Content and formatting guidelines were clearly not followed.
*  We already have plenty of guides on the topic (e.g., LAMP & LEMP stacks, MySQL).
*  Inappropriate topic for the Linode Community.
